# dexer
I use this script to install all the packages and tools that I require for CTFs and pentesting in one go 

I am trying to make it better and convenient.

### Usage

 1. `git clone https://github.com/x3rz/dexer.git ` 
 2. `cd dexter`
 3. `chmod +x install.sh`
 4. `sudo bash install.sh`


#### Bash Profile
Feel free to use it for HTB/THM or anything

**Setup:**
```bash
if [ -f ~/.bash_profile ]; then
  . ~/.bash_profile
fi
```
Append the above lines in .bashrc or .zshrc accordingly.
